Authors:  "T. Kimpson"
Description: "
This code calculates the orbital motion of an astrophysical body, such as a pulsar, on a background Kerr spacetime. Going beyond the point particle approximation, we instead model an extended spinning body via the Mathisson-Papertrou-Dixon equations, accouting for spin-spin, spin-orbit and spin-curvature couplings."
