title: "Iliad - General Relativistic Pulsar Timing"
date: 2015-12-01T00:00:00+01:00
Authors:  "T. Kimpson"
Description: "
 This code can be used to model the time-frequency signal from a pulsar orbiting a massive black hole (BH), accounting for all relativistic and astrophysical effects. It combines some of the methods used in the Ray Tracing and Orbital Dynamics repos."
