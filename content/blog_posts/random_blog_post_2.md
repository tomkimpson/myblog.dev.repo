I am currently a postdoc in computational physics at the [University of Oxford](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/group/predictability-weather-and-climate) where I explore reduced precision float arithmetic, stochastic methods and machine learning techniques applied to [climate simulations](www.google.com).

I got my PhD in Theoretical Astrophysics in 2021 from University College London, within the in the [Mullard Space Science Laboratory](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/). During this period I also spent some time at the [Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://perimeterinstitute.ca). My PhD research was focused on mathematical and computational modelling of pulsars in regions of strong gravity; how we can detect these systems and use them for precision tests of fundamental physics? As a member of the [LISA Consortium](https://www.elisascience.org/articles/lisa-consortium) I also investigated the prospects for gravitational radiation from these pulsar systems. 

I received my MPhys in Durham in 2016.

In addition to academic research, I have spent some time doing cool stuff in applied ML  and Data Science @  [Mind Foundry](https://www.mindfoundry.ai), [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com), [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/careers) and [Pace](https://www.pacerevenue.com).
