My research interests to date primarily been in relativistic astrophysics, strong-field gravity and numerical methods.

Recently I have also become interested in the application of computer science and information theory to climate modelling; the use of [mixed-precision arithmetic](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/2018/10/09/mixed-precision-a-strategy-for-new-science-opportunities/) and machine learning methods in conunction with emerging hardware for exascale computing of the next-generation of climate models.

A list of accepted peer-reviewed papers is below. I will try to keep this as an up to date list. Please also see the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=kimpson&searchtype=all&source=header).
