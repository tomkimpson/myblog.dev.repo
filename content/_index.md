I am currently a postdoc in computational physics at the [University of Oxford](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/group/predictability-weather-and-climate) where I research reduced precision float arithmetic, stochastic methods and machine learning techniques applied to [climate simulations](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/49/24390).

I got my PhD in theoretical astrophysics in 2021 from [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk), within the in the [Mullard Space Science Laboratory](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/). During this period I also spent some time at the [Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://perimeterinstitute.ca) as Visiting Graduate Fellow. 

My PhD research was focused on mathematical and computational modelling of pulsars in regions of strong gravity; how we can detect these systems and use them for precision tests of fundamental physics? I am also a member of the [LISA Consortium](https://www.elisascience.org/articles/lisa-consortium), exploring science with the next generation of space-based gravitational wave detectors.

I received my MPhys from the [University of Durham](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/physics/) in 2016.

In addition to academic research, I have spent some time doing cool stuff in applied ML and Data Science @  [Mind Foundry](https://www.mindfoundry.ai), [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com), [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/careers) and [Pace](https://www.pacerevenue.com).
